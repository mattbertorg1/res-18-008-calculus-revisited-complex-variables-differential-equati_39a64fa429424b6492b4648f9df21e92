Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources that covers the materials normally found in freshman- and sophomore-level introductory mathematics courses. _Complex Variables, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra_ is the third course in the series, consisting of 20 Videos, 3 Study Guides, and a set of Supplementary Notes. Students should have mastered the first two courses in the series ([Single Variable Calculus](/resources/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm) and [Multivariable Calculus](/resources/res-18-007-calculus-revisited-multivariable-calculus-fall-2011/index.htm)) before taking this course.

The series was first released in 1972, but equally valuable today for students who are learning these topics for the first time.
